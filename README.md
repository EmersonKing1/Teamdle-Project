How to Play
Your goal is to guess the mystery sports team of the day. With each guess, you'll receive color-coded feedback across five categories, helping you narrow down the answer:

League (e.g., NFL, MLB)

Conference (e.g., AFC, National League)

Division (e.g., NFC East, AL West)

Championships (Number of titles won)

Team Name

Green means it's a perfect match. Yellow means you're close. Gray means it's a miss.
